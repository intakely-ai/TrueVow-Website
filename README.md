# True Vow — Website Scaffold

This is a minimal scaffold for the True Vow website.

Files created:
- `index.html` — simple HTML page
- `styles.css` — base styles
- `script.js` — small client script
- `.vscode/settings.json` — workspace settings (placeholder Claude config)
- `package.json` — minimal package manifest

How to run locally (two options):

1) Using Node's http-server (no install required):

```powershell
npx http-server -c-1 .
```

2) Use the VS Code Live Server extension (recommended for quick dev).

Claude/"claude-code" configuration:
- Placeholder settings have been added to `.vscode/settings.json`. Replace the placeholder API key with your real key and update host settings if needed.

Next steps:
- If you want, I can install recommended extensions or add an integration for Claude/Anthropic; tell me the extension ID or allow me to search the marketplace.
